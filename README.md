# tQuery (an unnecessary copy of jQuery)

Hi there! This is my attempt at this cool [article/tutorial](https://gomakethings.com/create-your-own-personal-jquery) which teaches you how [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/) works under the hood by implementing it from scratch. In my attempt I also try to add TypeScript on top of it, because why not? 

## Hot to run it

- clone repository
- Run `pnpm i`
- Run `pnpm dev`
- Enter `http://localhost:5173` in your browser


Todo
- [x] finish the article
- [ ] add more methods from the library
- [ ] have some fun with it
